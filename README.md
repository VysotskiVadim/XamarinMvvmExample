# XamarinMvvmExample

Repository contains example of MVVM pattern usage for Xamarin.Andoid.

Hope you'll find following links usefull. 
- [Mvvm light getting started](https://mallibone.com/post/xamarinandroid-and-mvvm-light-bindings), I use Unity instead of MvvmLight service locator, and I don't use MvvmLight base view model.
- [Unity getting started](http://geekswithblogs.net/danielggarcia/archive/2014/01/23/introduction-to-dependency-injection-with-unity.aspx), feel free to use your favourite inversion of controll container, my favourite is unity.
